# üß† Pancreatic Cancer Prognosis Using Clinical Data

This repository contains a machine learning mini-project focused on predicting **pancreatic cancer prognosis** using **clinical data**.  
The goal is to analyze patient survival outcomes through **risk stratification** and **survival prediction** using statistical and ML models such as **Naive Bayes** and the **Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH)** model.

## üìò Project Overview

Pancreatic cancer has one of the lowest survival rates among all cancers. Early identification of high-risk patients can significantly improve treatment planning and clinical decision-making.

This project demonstrates:
- How to preprocess and analyze clinical datasets for survival modeling  
- How to predict short-term prognosis categories (e.g., high vs. low risk) using **Naive Bayes classification**  
- How to perform **survival analysis** using the **Cox Proportional Hazards model**  
- Visualization of Kaplan‚ÄìMeier survival curves to interpret model performance

## üß© Methodology

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
- Load and clean clinical data (missing value handling, encoding categorical variables)
- Split data into training and validation sets
- Perform normalization and transformation where necessary

### Step 2: Naive Bayes Classification
- Used to classify patients into **high-risk** and **low-risk** groups
- Threshold sweep performed to optimize classification balance accuracy
- Outputs include confusion matrices and threshold‚Äìaccuracy plots

### Step 3: Cox Proportional Hazards Model
- Utilizes survival times and censoring information
- Estimates the **hazard ratio** associated with clinical variables
- Helps interpret **time-dependent survival probability**
- Visualized through **Kaplan‚ÄìMeier survival curves**

## üìà Results Summary

### üîπ Step 2 ‚Äî Naive Bayes Classification
**Objective:**  
Classify patients into **High-Risk** and **Low-Risk** prognosis categories based on clinical variables.

**Key Outputs:**
- `nb_threshold_sweep_balacc.png` ‚Äî Balanced accuracy vs. threshold visualization  
- `nb_threshold_sweep_results.csv` ‚Äî Summary of performance metrics for various thresholds  
- `nb_predictions_best_threshold.csv` ‚Äî Predictions at the optimal threshold  
- `step2_summary.txt` ‚Äî Model evaluation and findings  

**Findings:**  
The Naive Bayes model effectively separated patients into risk categories.  
Threshold tuning improved balanced accuracy, showing stable performance across validation data.  
It served as a reliable baseline classifier before survival modeling.

### üîπ Step 3 ‚Äî Cox Proportional Hazards Model
**Objective:**  
Estimate **hazard ratios** and **time-dependent survival probabilities** to understand which clinical features most influence patient survival.

**Key Outputs:**
- `coxph_clinical_summary.csv` ‚Äî Detailed regression coefficients and p-values  
- `step3_cox_report.txt` ‚Äî Complete model summary and diagnostics  
- `km_clinical_median_risk.png` ‚Äî Kaplan‚ÄìMeier survival plot for risk groups  

**Findings:**  
The Cox model successfully identified key prognostic factors that significantly affected survival outcomes.  
Kaplan‚ÄìMeier analysis revealed distinct survival distributions between high- and low-risk groups, confirming the effectiveness of prior classification.  
The proportional hazards assumption was found to hold for most variables.

### üîπ Overall Outcome
Combining **Naive Bayes** classification and **CoxPH survival analysis** provided a comprehensive approach to prognosis prediction:
- Naive Bayes simplified early risk classification.  
- CoxPH offered interpretable survival insights with statistical rigor.  
- Together, they enhanced the reliability and interpretability of pancreatic cancer prognosis modeling.
